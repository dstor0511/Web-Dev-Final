                        A La Puerta was an invention of God. At one time in
                        church, we were talking about a man who wrote the word
                        eternity all over Sydney and became known for what he
                        did. Who knows how many people he will touch with that
                        simple word that implies so much. When I heard that, he
                        was spinning in my head. I was on the bus like any other
                        day, I had felt dissatisfied for a long time because I
                        wasn't doing anything to talk to people about Jesus and
                        maybe I could stop and talk to everyone on the bus, but
                        talking is something that costs me a lot, so I was
                        thinking of alternatives. God recorded in me the story
                        of the man in Sydney and I thought we could do something
                        similar. Perhaps not painting walls because in Colombia
                        that's not well seen, but something that people see and
                        makes them think of God. Then the idea of ​​stickers
                        came, something cute and simple; it is a piece of paper
                        but if it is aesthetically acceptable, many would keep
                        it. I told my sister and my friends, and we started
                        working on the project. The idea of ​​the website arose
                        from the need to attract people to a church and give
                        them tools in their life with God. Jesus wanted us to
                        make disciples, that is, to form people to follow him
                        and to form others. And that is the goal of wanting to
                        show them the church as a family in God. Somehow, on the
                        page, we are being family. Maybe we are not together,
                        but we are helping each other. Finally, here we
                        continue, we have not yet started distributing the
                        stickers or helping people with the name of A La Puerta,
                        but soon we will and we hope that God uses us for his
                        purpose and to conquer Bogotá for Him.<br />
